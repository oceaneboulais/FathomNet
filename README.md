# FathomNet
The two major goals of this project are to 
(1) establish a new baseline image dataset, FathomNet, optimized to directly accelerate development of modern, intelligent, automated analysis of underwater visual data, and 
(2) create baseline, modern, deep learning algorithms for analysis of underwater imagery to complete weakly supervised localization, image level labels, and bounding box algorithms.
